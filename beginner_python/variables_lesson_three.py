def variables():
    # Python 3: Variables

    # A variable is used to store data which can then be referenced and used later within the code. For example, 'num1 = 8' is a variable with the name 'num1' and stores the number '8':

    num1 = 8
    print(num1)

    # You can then use print statements to output whatever is stored within the variable. "" is not needed here as the variable does not count a string. If you were to run print("num1"), you would print literally 'num1', not '8'.

    # Try filling in below:

    num2 =
    print()

    # Now try a variable without any structure:
