def if_elif_else_statements():
    # Python 5: If, Elif and Else Statements

    # If and Elif (else if) are used to work out if a certain variable is satisfied. Else can be used to specify what will happen if the variable does not satisfy any of the if statements. For example:

    number = int(input("Pick a number between 1 and 10: "))

    if number == 2:
        print("Cool, that's the only even prime number!")
    elif number == 1:
        print("Number 1 was a pretty cool choice")
    else:
        print("Nice choice I guess. There are better numbers")

    # If should be used for the first time there is an if statement in a set of if statements. After the first time, elif (ELSE if) should be used.
    # Else statements will only be used once the if statements have been completed and if the variable does not satisfy any of the if statements
