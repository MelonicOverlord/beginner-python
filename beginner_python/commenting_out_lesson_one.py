    # Python 1: Commenting Out / Adding Notes

    # There are two main ways of commenting out and adding notes within a Python file. The first way is adding a # at the start of a line. The second way is adding ''' at the start and end of a block of code, to comment out multiple lines.

    # For example, all of these lines are commented out using the # function. Try commenting out "Welcome" below:

    #

    # Now try commenting out "This is cool" without any help:



    # Commenting out a block of code is just as easy. Here is some simple copypasta which has been commented out using the ''' method:

        I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component
        of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without
        realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

        There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run.
        The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU
        operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

    # Here is another copypasta: try commenting it out with the ''' yourself:

    According to world population studies, approximately 108 billion people have lived on this planet. Assuming that the average lifespan of all these people was 25, there has been around 2.7 trillion years of life, if we
    multiply this by the number of days in a year (365), there is a total of 985,500,000,000,000 days of life (985.5 trillion days). Not once in any of those days did anybody ask.
